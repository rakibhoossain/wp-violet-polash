         * You don't need to register the CPT within the activation function unless you need rewrite rules to be added
         * via flush_rewrite_rules() on activation. In that case, you'll want to register the CPT normally, via the
         * loader on the init hook, and also re-register it within the activation function and
         * call flush_rewrite_rules() to add the CPT rewrite rules.
